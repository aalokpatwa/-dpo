# From-Scratch Python Implementation of DPO on GPT-2 (124M)

This repository contains code for initializing a pre-trained GPT-2 and then aligning it using a fixed DPO dataset.

For this project, I used a synthetic dataset that encourages the model to complete all prompts with something regarding the University of Pennsylvania.
